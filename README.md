# Level-UP

Welcome to Level-UP, your daily habit tracker with a twist! Our app helps you build healthy routines by turning your daily tasks into a game where you gain experience points (XP) as you complete your habits.

But there's a challenge—complete your habits before the daily deadline or face the consequences! If you miss your habits for a day, you'll lose HP (Health Points), but don't worry—you can recover by staying on track the next day and continuing to conquer your habits!

Level-UP is developed by a group of students from Holberton Coding School Puerto Rico. We're passionate about using technology to help people improve their lives, one habit at a time.

As a team, we've combined our skills in coding, design, and gamification to make habit tracking fun and rewarding. Every day is a new adventure as you level up, and master your routines!
